        <p><img src="Ryan.JPG" alt="Ryan Conley" class="img_center" id="profile_img"></p>
        <p>Hi, my name is Ryan Conley and I am from Grayslake, Illinois. I am an
            undergraduate student attending Michigan State University. I am currently
            pursuing a degree in computer science and hope that one day I can apply it
            to other fields that I am interested in such as marine biology. I am an 
            adventerous person and love to explore different wildlife that the world
            has to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marine creatures are by far my favorite to study because I believe they are
            more difficult to find than species on land. It can sometimes be difficult 
            to find exotic aquatic life in the midwest, but I love to snorkel and try to 
            do so whenever I am near the ocean. Some of the places where I have snorkeled
            so far have been:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Honolulu, Hawaii</li>
                <li>Cozumel, Mexico</li>
                <li>Naples, Florida</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            I look forward to exploring more of our world's oceans and sharing what I
            find here. I will also try to post about interesting facts and articles
            when I come across them. Thanks for reading and good luck in your future
            explorations!
