            <h3>The Reef Triggerfish</h3>
            <address class="author">By <a rel="author" href="/about">Ryan Conley</a></address>
            <p>Posted on <time datetime="2021-10-13" title="October 13th, 2021">10/13/21</time></p>
            <p>The official state fish of Hawaii, the Reef Triggerfish, has 
                a name and appearance that are quite unique relative to other 
                sea creatures. The reef triggerfish sports a variety of different 
                colors from gold on the top side of their bodies, a black stripe 
                that runs down the middle, a blue tint around their mouths and a 
                white underbelly. These fish have strong jaws and sharp teeth which 
                allow them to pick off food easily from coral reefs. They primarily 
                eat algae, snails, and other small organisms to which their teeth are 
                extremely lethal. When selecting a name for this odd creature, local 
                tribes took note of its odd snout and appropriately called it 
                humuhumunukunukuapuaa, which in their language means 
                <q>triggerfish with a snout like a pig</q>. It certainly is an interesting 
                name, but Reef Triggerfish is definitely easier to pronunciate. 
                In order to get a glimpse of this amazing fish, you will have to take 
                a trip to a country along the Pacific ocean as they are primarily found 
                there. I personally got to encounter this fish on a visit to Hanauma Bay, 
                a state park in Hawaii. Hanauma Bay is located on the island of Oahu and I 
                highly recommend a visit there.</p>

            <h3>Threats To Coral Reefs</h3>
            <address class="author">By <a rel="author" href="/about">Ryan Conley</a></address>
            <p>Posted on <time datetime="2021-10-13" title="October 13th, 2021">10/13/21</time> </p>
            <p>Over the last few years, coral reefs have been dying at a surprisingly high 
                rate. Coral reefs are a fundamental ecosystem and serve as a habitat for a 
                wide variety of both aquatic plants and animals. Scientists have studied this 
                critical issue and have come up with a multitude of reasons as to why they are 
                decreasing as the rate they are. They found that human activities play a large 
                role in these close to shore environments. A lot of physical damage occurs to 
                coral when people play around the coral and touch it. In addition, the sunscreen 
                that people apply contains many harmful chemicals that can kill the coral
                formations. Pollution has also played a big role in hindering the growth of coral 
                reefs. Sedimentation along shore lines as well as human pollution introduced to 
                waterways hurt coral reef ecosystems. One of the biggest factors that harms 
                coral is global warming. Because of our actions, water temperature has been 
                increasing at a high rate each year and this causes the amount of carbon dioxide 
                in seawater to increase. This increase in CO2 puts stress on the coral. With all 
                this being said, I think it is important for us all to consider how our actions 
                impact the environment as well as ways we can help rebuild our amazing coral reefs.</p>
